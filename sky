  Technical Problems

    The first question was: Given a file containing the description of seats on a plane, implement an algorithm that finds the cheapest N consecutive seats on the same row. The input file give the position of each seat, wether they are already taken and the price of the seat. Additionally, the value of N is provided.

Research about the company
1. Read a lot about skyscanner, (they are making this for rejecting candidates)
2. Recollect all about your past experiences (tough for 10+ guys as it was for me),
   and prepare to make nice user/technical stories about it. They focus too much
   on your past challenges than what you are now.
