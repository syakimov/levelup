when having a load balancer how do you handle storage

On the browser
  cookies can be used as storage
    upsides
      no db overhead
    downsides
      users can disable cookies
      cookies can be cleaned
      cookies have limited size
      descripting the cookie overhead

On the server
  store sessions on the server as well as db
    you have to redirect users to the same server each time (stickiness)
      implement this by saving a key/ip address of the server or by rule on (username, location, ip)
      this has to be done in the load balancer
    downsides
      lack of failover, all sessions are lost

On a shared db that is replicated
  Memcached

the db has to be replicated on different machines
  and they have to be connected to a load balancer as well
