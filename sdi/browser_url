 8. Tell me the whole process that happens after entering a URL in the browser to seeing the website rendered. Are servers hit directly?

1. Type string into the address bar
2. The browser checks the cache for a
    DNS record to find the corresponding Ip address
  The browser checks four caches:
    a) the browser cache of the recently visited sites
    b) the OS cache
    c) the router cache
    d) ISP(Internet Service Provider) cache ?
    e) ISP's DNS server inits a DNS query (recursive) to find the ip
        example with maps.google.com
          "." root domain will nav to ".com" name server
          ".com" will nav to "google.com" name server
          "google.com" will find the ip and give it back
3. The browser inits a tcp conn with the server
    a) browsers use internet protocols TCP
    b) the browser establishes TCP connection using TCP/IP three-way handshake
        the client and the server exchange SYN and ACK msg
          i) browser sends SYN packet to the server
         ii) if server has open port it responds with SYN/ACK
        iii) the browser acknowledges with ACK package
4. The browser sends a request adding additional (cookies, connection, info)
5. The server handles the request and sends back response
  a) On the server is running web server (Apache, IIS)
  b) The web server passes the request to a req handler (ASP.NET, Rails..)
  c) The application code reads the request and returns response
6. The server replies with a web page response and status code
7. The browser renders the request

DNS is a db that keeps url-ip as key-value pairs
